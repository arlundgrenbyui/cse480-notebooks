Is it possible that by using the principles of parallelism and concurrency we could solve NP problems in P time (the same number of steps, obviously, but with more space to divide and conquer.)? Couldn't it be possible that we could obtain enough space and speed that the non-deterministic aspect of NP became trivial?\n",
